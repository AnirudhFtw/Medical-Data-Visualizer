# 🩺 Medical Data Visualizer

This project analyzes medical examination data to explore the relationship between various health indicators and the presence of cardiovascular disease. It visualizes the data through categorical plots and a heatmap showing feature correlations after data cleaning and transformation.This project was developed as part of the freeCodeCamp **Data Analysis with Python** certification. It provides insights into health features and their relationships using visualization.
